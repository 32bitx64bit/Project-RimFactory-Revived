WIP - Unstable - Beta
Please know by using this mod theres a risk of things being removed or break.
Until a stable release are ready.

I loved this mod in B18 and B19 and there never really came a 1.0 or 1.1
So i looking into updating it, since Spdskatr properly wont come back.
i saw AbnerChen made an unofficial ver. update.

I used this in combination with own work and original to update to 1.1
I hope this mod can be a Continuation of Spdskatr excellent mod.


New in this version:
-Patch for Industrial rollers (clean up and merge menus)
-Grouped items to fill up less.
-Architech menu icon
-updated version, harmony and a few other things.

Any bugs, suggestion or other are VERY welcome as i cant test i all myself.

Question
Do you want all in one mod? or 4 seprate mods like PFR 1.0 did
-Core (this one)
-Storage (not up yet)
-Drones (not up yet)
-Insanity (not up yet)
I can add them 1 by 1 if wanted?
i think drones should be in, let me know what you think?

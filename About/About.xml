WIP - Unstable - Beta
Please know by using this mod theres a risk of things being removed or break.
Until a stable release are ready.

This mod adds:
This mod is together with Industrial Rollers an Awesome way to automate and create factories and such in Rimworld.
I always loved those 2 mods, and now i have the chance to update one of them

Disclaimer
This was my Favorite mod in B18 and B19 and there never really came a 1.0 or 1.1
So i was looking into updating it, since Spdskatr properbly wont come back.
i saw AbnerChen made asemblies update and created a PR but Spdskatr didnt update.

I used this in combination with my own work and original to update to 1.1
I hope this mod can be a Continuation of Spdskatr excellent mod.
i dont want credit, i really just want my favorite mod back to rimworld 1.1 standard

I sadly have no C# skills so can't build upon assemblies, so if some one wanna take over or colab feel free to contact me.



Any bugs, suggestion or other are VERY welcome as i cant test i all myself.

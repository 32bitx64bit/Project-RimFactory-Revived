    <discoveredLetterTitle>About: Drone are now lv 10</discoveredLetterTitle>
    <discoveredLetterText>You now have basic knowledge about drones and can now start utilize them for different tasks. This also unlocks DroneCultivator research which let you Automate your agriculture needs. \n This will set any drones base level to 10. \n Unless other settings for specific dronestation is specified.</discoveredLetterText>

    <description>Through continuous and methodical research on drone systems, current drone presets can be improved upon and be made much more efficient than their previous versions. These new upgrades include a greater layout of drone variants capable of performing even more complex tasks.\n\nThis research level will upgrade a drone's base stats to level 15.</description>

# Project-RimFactory-Revived

## Factorio Inspired Automation mod in RimWorld
This is my overhaul of one of my favorite mods from B18 RW.
I tried stay in line with how it was back then but expanding on functions and machines to great a even better story for it.

Over the past month i have been working on this mod, many great ppl have joined and contributed to make this mod truly amazing and better than i ever imagined.
I Truly appriciate what this have become, not just some modding experiance, but it became a great little community of modders, helping on PRF and share skills across their own mods.

This is still a work in progress project, and it properly always will be.
But we are very close to a stable release with our 2.5.0 release which overhauled MANY mechanics.


If you have any ideas, bugs or other things, feel free to share them with us with a Issue, steam comment or our discord.




## Idea behind this mod
PRF is a mod that focus on automating many task in RW without going too far away from Vanilla balance.
This fit in line with many other great mods.

We have tried keep core clean and not Too OverPowered, and moved OP stuff out in Insanity and other sub mods instead.

This mod adds a bunch of machines and new types of automation, that will let you automate certain things in RW that otherwise would had pawns needed.
Not every task can be automated though. you will still need pawns to eat your food, defend your colony, do raiding and trading and research.

This adds new Factorio like buildings that has a Input and a Output and will work be them self if you supply resources.
It also adds conveyor belts that let you move things around on your base.

It has a small selection of storage options too.

We have tried make more of balance and story than there earlier was in PRF, so it now has more ingame content, and info/story/flavour text to give at good all around Feeling.

## Disclaimer
This was my Favorite mod in B18 and B19 and there never really came a 1.0 or 1.1
So i was looking into updating it, since Spdskatr properbly wont come back.
i saw AbnerChen made asemblies update and created a PR but Spdskatr didnt update.

I used this in combination with my own work and original to update to 1.1
I hope this mod can be a Continuation of Spdskatr excellent mod.
i dont want credit, i really just want my favorite mod back to rimworld 1.1/1.2 standard

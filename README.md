## Disclaimer
This was my Favorite mod in B18 and B19 and there never really came a 1.0 or 1.1
So i was looking into updating it, since Spdskatr properbly wont come back.
i saw AbnerChen made asemblies update and created a PR but Spdskatr didnt update.

I used this in combination with my own work and original to update to 1.1
I hope this mod can be a Continuation of Spdskatr excellent mod.
i dont want credit, i really just want my favorite mod back to rimworld 1.1 standard

I sadly have no C# skills so can't build upon assemblies, so if some one wanna take over or colab feel free to contact me.


# New in this version:
- Patch for Industrial Rollers (clean up menus)
- Changed Menu name to Industrial to merge menus with Industrial Rollers
- Grouped items in Menu
- Architech menu icon (support)
- updated assemblies by AbnerChen
- Working with AutoSort in 1.1
- Balanced research and cost of Deep Drilling.
- New textures aniamal station,
- Updated texture for storage crates by Chicken Plucker(more will come)
- Included Rest of SS bigger battieries instead of just 2.
- Research AI bench now only 3x1 instead of 5x2
- Included PRF - Storage into Core again.
- Moved PaperClips research out of core into Insanity (not out yet)

Known Errors:
- When placing more then 1 assembler, it throw a backstory error, dunno why, but need assemblies updated.
Should work anyways, just ignore that error.


Any bugs, suggestion or other are VERY welcome as i cant test i all myself.
Feel free to help me update/build upon this version and lets make PRF return to rimworld!
Im not capble to do any c# work, so if you are? feel free to help me!
## Question
Do you want all in one mod? or 4 seprate mods like PFR 1.0 did (updated for now)
-Core (this one)
-Storage (In core now)
-Drones (will be seprate later)
-Insanity (will be seprate later, maybe.... seems like no one want it)

- Should i Remove stuffed from animal stations and group them?
- If yes what matrial shall it be made off?
